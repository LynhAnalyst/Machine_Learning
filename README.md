## Description
The project aims to build a model to predict auto insurance prices based on factors such as vehicle characteristics, driving records, accident history data, and customer information. The goal is to optimize the insurance pricing process, helping insurance companies provide fair and appropriate prices for each customer.

## Main features
* Customer data analysis: Explore and clean data, analyze factors affecting insurance prices.
* Building prediction models: Using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting models to predict insurance prices.
* Evaluate the model: Use evaluation indices such as MAE, RMSE to measure the accuracy of the model.
* Deploy the model: Deploy the model to the web or application to predict insurance prices in real time.

## Target
* Providing transparent and effective insurance pricing solutions.
* Minimize risks for insurance companies by determining appropriate prices for each type of customer.
* Enhance customer experience through a quick and accurate pricing process.

## Usage
* Python: The main language used for data processing and model building.
* Pandas, NumPy: Data processing and analysis library.
* K-Means, KNN, LN,... : Libraries used to build and train machine learning models.
* Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization library.
